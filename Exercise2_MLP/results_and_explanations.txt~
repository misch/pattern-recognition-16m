Results and explanations:

In the file crossValid.csv there are the cross-validation values with their params.

Column 1: number of neurons
Colunm 2: learning Rate (which seems not to have an impact for some readon)
Column 3-6: Accuracy on different training- and testsets
Column 7: Average accuracy.


The result seems not to depend on the learning ratio, which is odd.
The only explanation I can think of, is that the high number of max epochs we used (1000) allowed it to converge to the same net.
